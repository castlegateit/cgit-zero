# Zero

Zero is a simple WordPress theme designed to act as a starting point for
development and customization. It contains theme files for pages, posts, and
archives but does not provide any style information.

## Templates

The theme contains templates for an archives page and a simple contact page.
The templates are assigned by page slug, but they can be modified so that they
can be used with any page in the WordPress administration screen. See the
[WordPress documentation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy) for
details.

## Widgets and Menus

The `functions.php` file defines one [widget
area](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets) (dynamic sidebar) and one
customizable [navigation menu](http://codex.wordpress.org/Navigation_Menus).
These are provided as examples and can be extended or removed as required.
